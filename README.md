# TikTok-Livestream-Chat-Connector
A Node.js module to retrieve and decode livestream chat data from [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/) by connecting to TikTok's internal WebCast push service. The module includes a wrapper that connects to the WebCast service using the username (`uniqueId`). This allows you to connect to your own live chat as well as the live chat of other streamers. No credentials are required. Besides chat messages, other events such as members joining and gifts can be monitored.
